# NeuronAnalysis

Here we developed a graphical user interface (GUI)-based open-source software to analyze fluorescence micrographs of neurons for quantitative analysis of neurite length and branching. Files are automatically imported, and visual and numeric results are saved as standard file formats for further downstream processing and analysis. The main interface contains modules for importing data, pre-processing, segmentation, neurite classification and the export of quantitative measurements.
Some example raw images can be found in 'Test Images' folder for testing the software.
The user can load the input data in two ways: 
  (1) loading raw neuronal images,
  (2) importing data which have been segmented or skeletonized before.
